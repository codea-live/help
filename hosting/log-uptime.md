# Log Uptime

## In this guide...

#### We will ping our website, every 3 minutes, and send the response time to [Statuspage](https://statuspage.io) so we can log it in a graph.

### How do we know if it goes offline?

If you are using Cloudflare, and the website times out due to no connection with the website server, you may see around[ 30,000ms](https://accord.statuspage.io/#month) in the graph.
